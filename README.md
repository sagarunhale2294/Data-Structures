# Data Structures Practical Programs in Java

Hello! 👋
This repo contains simple and practical Java programs for understanding and working with basic data structures like **Linked List**, **Binary Tree**, and **Array**. These are mostly created for learning purposes – useful for students, beginners, or anyone who wants to revise data structures in Java.

## 📚 What's Inside?

### 🔗 Linked List

* Singly Linked List (with insert, delete, traverse functions)
* Doubly Linked List (with forward and backward traversal)

### 🌳 Binary Tree

* Binary Search Tree (insert, delete, search, and tree traversals – inorder, preorder, postorder)

### 📦 Array

* Basic array operations like insert, delete, search
* Dynamic resizing array (like how ArrayList works internally)

All programs are written in plain Java with clear comments to help you understand the logic easily.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo using this command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sagarunhale2294/data-structures.git
   ```

2. Open the project in any IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse or even VS Code.

3. Navigate to the folder and run the `.java` files you want to try out.

If you're using terminal, you can compile and run using:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

If you have better solutions, more examples, or want to add new data structures, feel free to raise a PR. I’ll be happy to review and merge them.
